    <h2> What is my Component? </h2>
    <h4>Range Slider Component:</h4>
    <p>The Range Slider is simple. It's a long slider that displays the current
    value of where in respect to the select the user's selection is placed.</p>
    <h4>Click Me Button:</h4>
    <p>Instead of displaying the slider value immediately I wanted the user to
        be able to click and discover what there value was. 
    </p>
        
      <h2> What it does? </h2>
    <p>Both components enable the user to rate the food listed above. </p>
    
    <h2> How to use it? </h2>
    <p> Drag the slider the your desired path on the x-axis and then click
        the value button to see what your rating is for the dessert. </p>

    <h2> Snippets of code that I had to understand to write the component </h2>
    <p>Photos and Description</p>
        <img src="pictures/screencap1.png" class="screencap">
    
        <p>The first piece of code I had to understand to write was
        a simple array and component function to pass my information to
        my Javascript file. Although it seems like an easy task. I was 
        behind and implemented this incorrectly. With the help of Professor
        this was the first step into finding the correct answer. Thus my first
        capture, constructing a food array with the desired data values. Which is
        simple defining the elements and then setting the data points. One the array
        is defined create the variable component and pass the food array. Then append
        it.</p>    
        
        <img src="pictures/screencap2.png" class="screencap">
        
         <p>The second piece of code I had to understand to write was
        the beginning function of my MakeSlider. First and
         foremost, we must pass a list as parameter in the 
         function. With that being said, I also used a for loop
         to iterate through variables and elements I created.</p>  
        
        <img src="pictures/screencap3.png" class="screencap">
       
        <p>The third piece of code I had to understand to write was
        my button function. Honestly one of the hardest parts of the 
        assignment. In plain terms. I first had to create the button
        element. Then append it to the parent class. On top of that
        I have to create an onclick function that grabbed every sliders
        value and displayed it to the user.</p>
